## Sword Dropping Mechanic

Maybe the player could drop their sword if hit by an enemy and then all they have is their fist unless they go and pick it up again. 

Maybe this can only happen to ben lol. If he gets to the end of the level with out his sword Rovert should give it to him and say something like "you dropped your sword back there, be more careful next time!".

It's sort of like a shield mechanic for Ben cause he can take an extra hit if he has his sword. If he gets hit without his sword he just dies.
